# General purpose modular bot
The main branch will be for my personal use, and I will add production branches for public use later.
---
The general idea of the bot is to provide an easy wireframe for me (and other people) to extend regular discord bot functionality with in a clean way, instead of having it in one codebase. The main module will handle all the configs and events, then there would be modules that it would tap into to call their events.
example of such modules are: github sync module, chat backup module, etc...
